# Solving programming questions in Python

>I fear data structure first, when I first get my hands on it, when I was searching how to become a better programmer, the result was learn data structure and algorithms, I tried to learn them, it flew over my head, I didn't get anything, even doing a factorial, or a palindrome program is hard for me.
And Now, I've overcome my fear, doing good at data structures and algorithms but I want to do better, I can't be average... 
I will be mentioning everything I've learn, from the places I learn, how I overcame my fear, I will post it here, for someone outthere who need this. And who will became better than anyone else.
This was ArshErgon. planning to do something impossible, but deep down he knows he can do this.(29-Jan-2022)

>People have projects, have experience, have tons of certificates, have graduated from tops colleges, have good connections who can help them if they stuck on somewhere, and I? what I have? how can I be different from others? I never knew my full potential ever, everyday is going like I'm not doing enough, I'm not enough, I have work more, and I truly have to work more than anyone else, have lied alot to myself, to others, did an impossible promise to someone, someone who matter alot in my life, and for that one person I have to do it, no matter how much my body hurts, how much my eyes hurts I need to code, I need to improve my problem solving skills, I have high persuits, I'm not doing all this just for money or fame, I'm doing this to improve, to learn, to get some better education which I always wanted, but never deserved. @ArshErgon(3/Feb/2022)


**What books I used for reference?** *most of  the books can be found on Pdfdrive or* z-lib(darkweb)
1. Hands on data structure of Python by Basant Agarwal and benjamin baka
2. Elements of programming in Python
3. Data Structures and algorithmic thinking with python
4. Cracking the coding interview

### Focus on how one solution is different from another, Learn Big O

**WebSites I used for learning Data Structures**
1. TutorialsPoint
2. StackOverflow
3. GreeksForGreeks
4. Medium
5. Programiz
6. w3schools


**Mainly which data structures I practice or learn the most?**
1. Array
2. LinkedList
3. HashMap
4. Recursion
5. Sets, lists
6. Trees(BT, BST, AVL, RBT)
7. Graphs
8. Sorting Algorithms (Insertation sorts, merge sort, quick sort)
9. Strings

**Websites I used for practice**
1. Leetcode *90%*
2. Codewars *60%:started here*
3. Algomonster *there questions are good but I was not a paid user*
4. GreeksForGreeks *some time* *they have some terrible testcases and sometimes their own code fails*
5. CodeSignal *Their questions are good but sometimes even a simple questions are quite tricky*

**YouTubers I followed**
1. Neetcode: the way he breaks down problems are superb, started his channel as an unempoly and after 1 year he's a Googler
2. Nickwhite: I love his problem breaking techniques
3. Clement: The kid who broke in Google and Facebook after 6 months of coding; and the founder of AlgoExpert
4. Aron Jack: just to get some kick in my career 

**Have Taken Udemy Courses also**
1. Master the coding interview Data Structures and Algorithm, Codes are in JavaScript but can be translated in any other language (https://www.udemy.com/share/101qSq3@oQOB0MwCTxZBwWG4OdKYabyB5Ks9DdTbxJl8r3-lHs4aQl0wP2Q_-wojn5pUk313YA==/)

**Who am I?**
> I'm Arsh, I graduated from a trie 4 or trie 5 college didn't pass GATE paper or something to get admission nor I'm a topper, or someone who scored 90% in 12th, no I belongs to backbenchers, I was a terrible student, I know about programming before my college after doing my boards I have taken some classes for python, I mostly learn things from Google and PDFs, I belong from a medical background, not a genius in MatheMatics, Covid hit, I left programming for 1.5 years and when my college is about to get over at that time I came into my senses that what next? from there I started learning Data Structures and Algorithm it was hard to figure out first but I stick on it, I didn't leave it

**Questions which came in my mind when I was preparing**
1. Can you seriously think you can do this?
2. There are people who are doing data structures and algorithms since they are 8, you think you can beat them?
3. When will you stop lying to yourself?
4. All I can do is brute force how will I come up with Optimual solution?
5. I'm sorry I can't do this!!!!!!!!
6. I have to do this, No one is going to do this for me.
7. I don't have time, I wish I had started learning Data Structures last year.
8. I'm not doing my 100%, I have to do more, more, more!
