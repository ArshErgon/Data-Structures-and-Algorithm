# Solving programming questions in Python

I fear data structure first, when I first get my hands on it, when I was searching how to become a better programmer, the result was learn data structure and algorithms, I tried to learn them, it flew over my head, I didn't get anything, even doing a factorial, or a palindrome program is hard for me.
And Now, I've overcome my fear, doing good at data structures and algorithms but I want to do better, I can't be average... 
I will be mentioning everything I've learn, from the places I learn, how I overcame my fear, I will post it here, for someone outthere who need this. And who will became better than anyone else.
This was ArshErgon. planning to do something impossible, but deep down he knows he can do this.(29-Jan-2022)

4. GreeksForGreeks *some time*
5. codeSignal *some time*

**YouTubers I followed**
1. Neetcode: the way he breaks down problems are superb, started his channel as an unempoly and after 1 year he's a Googler
2. Nickwhite: I love his problem breaking techniques
3. Clement: The kid who broke in Google and Facebook after 6 months of coding; and the founder of AlgoExpert
4. Aron Jack: just to get some kick in my career 

**Have Taken Udemy Courses also**
