I fear data structure first, when I first get my hands on it, when I was searching how to become a better programmer, the result was learn data structure and algorithms, I tried to learn them, it flew over my head, I didn't get anything, even doing a factorial, or a palindrome program is hard for me.
And Now, I've overcome my fear, doing good at data structures and algorithms but I want to do better, I can't be average... 
I will be mentioning everything I've learn, from the places I learn, how I overcame my fear, I will post it here, for someone outthere who need this. And who will became better than anyone else.
