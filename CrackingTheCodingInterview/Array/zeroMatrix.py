# Zero Matrix: Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and
# column are set to 0.

# eg: [                     ----> [
#     [1, 2, 3],                    [0, 0, 3],
#     [4, 0, 6],                    [0, 0, 0], 
#     [0, 8, 9],                    [0, 0, 0],
# ]                                 ]
